# Node-Blog

This is a simple web-based Blog/Posts apllication that is mainly built on `NodeJs`but uses other important modules like :-

1. `Express-JS`

2. `Mongoose-DB` for storing the data such as posts/ images/ author credentials etc.(DBMS)

3. `Multer` for uploading a file/image from the local machine.

4. `monk` A tiny layer that provides simple yet substantial usability improvements for MongoDB usage within Node.JS.

5. `BodyParser`and `Cookie Parser` for parsing the text/ data into processable form

6. `Express-validator` for validation of respective text/numeric form fields in the app.

7. `Jade` for convenient use of HTML while designming the view pages as well the home page for the website.

8. `CKEditor` as a text-editor while creating the content of a blog/post.

9. `Connect-Flash` for displaying the error in wrong input to the forms and success to the correct input while filling a form.

And many other modules using `npm`.

# The app can serve the following functionalities:-

1. `Create a blog`.

2. `Add Image` to the blog.

3. `Put Comments` to the post along with the details of the `author` of the `comment`.

4. `Read-More` option for long-blogs or multiple images.

Well that was something I learned while trying to study about NodeJS and its other functionalities.
